        - Get the JSON data from the "exampleAlbum.json" file. (Data(contentsOf: URL))
        - Try to decode the JSON using JSONDecoder just like you would if you got this data from an API.
        - Check for errors. This is important because it will help you make sure you've correctly implemented the init(from decoder: Decoder) throws initializer in your model objects by giving you an error about what you have potentially done wrong.
